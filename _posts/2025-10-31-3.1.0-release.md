Pachli 3.1.0 is now available. This release allows you to re-order attachments and shows if a post is part of a thread, both features suggested by users. It also contains translation updates and a number of bug fixes.

Work to support [Mastodon quote posts](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/09/introducing-quote-posts/) is ongoing, and will appear in Pachli Current in the first week of November to allow plenty of time for feedback ahead of inclusion in the release at the end of November.

## New features and other improvements

### Re-order attachments when writing posts

[@theoteno@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@theoteno) suggested (#[1187](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1187)) Pachli should support re-ordering attachments when writing posts.

That's a great idea, and now you can. There are three ways to do this:

1. From the "&hellip;" menu on each attachment choose one of the "Move up" and "Move down" options.
2. A new "drag handle" is under each preview image, press and drag it to re-order.
3. Long-press anywhere on the attachment and it becomes draggable to re-order.

This video shows all three approaches in action.

### Show whether a post is a reply in the post "header"

[Emanuele Panz](https://phpc.social/@thepanz) and [Johan](https://mastodon.social/@_nibbles) suggested (#[1813](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1813)) adding an indicator above a post to show if it was part of a thread, using the same area that shows if a post has been boosted.

In this example Kalle is replying to someone else.

<img alt="Reply to someone else" src="/assets/posts/2025-10-xx-3.1.0-release/reply-to-other.png" class="shadow" width="486" height="204">

In this example the Mastodon Engineering team are replying to themselves to the continue the thread.

## Significant bug fixes

### Support push notifications on GoToSocial

[Konstantinos Kavourakis](https://fedi.charlie2alpha.org/@charlie2alpha) reported (#[1849](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1849)) an API incompatibility between Mastodon and GoToSocial that meant push notifications did not work on GoToSocial servers. Fixed in #[1888](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1888).

### Allow for filters to be cleared on non-cached timelines

[Jules](https://mastodon.catgirl.cloud/@blitter) opened an issue (#[1875](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1875), their first contribution to Pachli) noting the "Show anyway" button wasn't working on filtered posts on some timelines. Fixed with #[1887](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1887).

### Stop small UI jumps when scrolling on network timelines

Feedback from several people on Google Play reported occasional small "jumps" when scrolling on the Local and Federated timelines. That was fixed with #[1872](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1872).

### Don't show unavailable accessibility actions

Sometimes accessibility actions (e.g., with TalkBack enabled) could show you invalid actions for the current state. For example, to boost a private post.

Those have been fixed with #[1862](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1862).

### Fix black theme rendering

The fully-black theme was appearing with a mix of colours ever since the switch to edge-to-edge display. Fixed with #[1857](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1857).

### Update attachment preview after changing focal point

Changing the focal point of an image attachment while writing a post didn't update the image preview to reflect the new focal point. Fixed with #[1850](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1850/commits/2980e0864fa7a83a135d04d0797baee4cea67dca).

### Update counts when acting on a post

If you boosted or favourited a post the count displayed next to the button wasn't updated. Now it is, immediately after you tap the button, and again when the action completes, so you'll see the most up-to-date information (#[1848](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commit/374f51f78d56e2ad31cda069d9cefb80adfb3944))
