## Significant bug fixes

### Clear database corruption at startup to prevent a crash

If you were ever logged in with multiple accounts and then logged one of them out then Pachli's database may have contained orphaned data from the account you logged out.

This data remains inaccessible, and is fully deleted if you uninstall Pachli, but it shouldn't have been there.

Work in the 2.10.0 release to prevent this didn't completely clear all the orphaned data at startup, and if any was present Pachli would crash. These crashes were first reported by [robovoice1](https://github.com/robovoice1) in #[1320](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1320).

This has been fixed.

### "Show anyway" didn't always work

[Ângelo Suzuki](https://mas.to/@tinsuke) noticed the "Show anyway" button on filtered posts didn't always work on some timelines, like "Trending posts" or an account's profile.

They included a fix, in #[1234](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1234).

### Not all languages were appearing in Android's system settings

Pachli allows you to choose the UI language. You can do this within the app, with Preferences > Language.

You can also do this through Android's system settings, Settings > Apps > Pachli > Language.

[Russssty](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=rastislav.podracky@outlook.com) reported (#[1323](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1323)) that Slovak wasn't appearing in the languages available through system settings.

Examination showed a number of languages were missing from this list, and they have all been included, along with additional controls to ensure new languages are always included.

The affected languages were:

- Ελληνικά / Greek
- Suomi / Finnish
- Frysk / Western Frisian
- Indonesia / Indonesian
- Latviešu / Latvian
- മലയാളം / Malayalam
- සිංහල / Sinhala
- Slovenčina / Slovak
