Pachli 2.16.1 is now available, fixing a bug in 2.16.0 where filters were not applied to some timelines. 

<!--more-->

## Significant bug fixes

###  Correctly hide filtered posts from public timelines

Content filters configured to **hide** posts **were not** being applied to public timelines (local, federated, trending, hashtags, and links), resulting in users seeing posts they expected to be removed.

Content filters set to warn *were* applied correctly, as were account filters, and any filters for your home and notification timelines.

Thanks to [@dhamlinmusic@dragonscave.space](https://dragonscave.space/@dhamlinmusic) for reporting this.
