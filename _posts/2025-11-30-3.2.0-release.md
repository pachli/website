Pachli 3.2.0 is now available. This release applies your filters to search results, bookmarks, and favourites (if your server supports this), shows account pronouns throughout the UI, and supports Mastodon's new "[quote post](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/09/introducing-quote-posts/)" feature.

<!--more-->

## New features and other improvements

### Apply "Public" filters to search results, "Home" filters to bookmarks and favourites

Mastodon is changing how and where your content filters are applied.

Previously search results, bookmarks, and favourites were not filtered.

Soon they will be, and Pachli will apply those filters.

In search results, filters marked for "Public" are used.

For bookmarks and favourites the "Home" context is used. However, if you have set the filter to "Hide" Mastodon will change it to "Warn" instead. The thinking here is if you have gone to the trouble of bookmarking or favouriting the post then you do want to be able to see it, even if a filter would normally hide it.

### Display account pronouns

[Jules](https://mastodon.catgirl.cloud/@blitter) suggested Pachli could show account pronouns if present, and now it does.

The new default behaviour shows pronouns when writing a post. This gives the most utility, showing pronouns at the point they are most useful, without overloading the rest of the UI with additional information.

If you reply to an account with pronouns set they are shown at the end of the account information.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/reply-pronouns.png" class="shadow" alt="Pronouns display when replying" width="486" height="386">

@-mentioning another account when writing a post (either a new post, or a reply) shows the pronouns in the auto-complete list.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/at-mention-pronouns.png" class="shadow" alt="Pronouns when mentioning accounts" width="486" height="374">

In both cases the user may have pronouns that are too long to display in the available space. If this happens you can tap the pronouns button to see the full text.

You can choose where to display pronouns with a new preference setting:

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/pref-pronouns.png" class="shadow" alt="New 'Show account pronouns' preference" width="486" height="348">

The options are:

- **Everywhere**; pronouns are shown everywhere the account information is shown, in timelines, search results, suggested accounts, when writing a post, and so on.
- **When writing a post**; pronouns are shown when writing a reply, or at-mentioning another account. As already noted, this is the default behaviour.
- **Nowhere**; pronouns are not shown. For example, this is useful if your language does not have gendered pronouns.

To make pronouns visible for your account edit your account information and add a new field. The field's name must be one of the following (in upper or lower case) for Pachli to recognise it as containing pronouns:

- الضمائر
- pronomes
- pronom
- pronoms
- pronomen
- Αντωνυμίες
- pronoun
- pronouns
- pronomoj
- pronombres
- ضمایر
- pronominit
- pronoms
- forainmneacha
- riochdairean
- כינויי גוף
- לשון פנייה
- pronomina
- kata ganti
- pronomi
- 代名詞
- 인칭 대명사
- Įvardžiai
- vietniekv
- vietniekvārdi
- vietniekvārds
- voornaamwoorden
- pronomen
- personlig pronomen
- zaimki
- pronome
- pronume
- местоим
- местоимения
- Произношение
- zamirler
- Займенники
- 人称
- 人稱
- 称谓
- 人称代词
- 別名

Pachli displays whatever value you add to this field as your account's pronouns.

This also works for people who use [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/) and [Moshidon](https://lucasggamerm.github.io/moshidon/).

### Quote posts

Mastodon 4.5 introduced a new "quote post". This is similar to a boost -- it starts a new thread -- but allows you to add your own commentary to the post.

Pachli 3.2.0 supports quote posts and provides a number of features to allow you to control how your posts are quoted.

If your server does not support Mastodon's "quote post" feature these changes are all disabled.

#### Setting a default quote policy

You can control whether other people can quote your posts. This setting is per-account, open "Account preferences" to change it.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/account-pref-quote.png" class="shadow" alt="'Who can quote your posts' preference" width="486" height="82">

This setting is synchronised with your server.

#### Setting a quote policy when writing a post

The post editor has a new icon to control who can quote the post, appearing third-from-left. Tap this to open a sheet to change the quoting policy for this post only. 

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/compose-pref-quote.png" class="shadow" alt="'Who can quote your post' popup when writing a post" width="486" height="620">

> Note: This UI will change in future Pachli versions, I'm aware two similar/identical icons next to each other can be confusing.

Mastodon does not allow posts with a privacy setting of "Followers only" or "Direct" to be quotable. Pachli prompts you to change the "Who can quote this post?" setting if you choose an incompatible privacy setting. 

#### Quoting a post

The option to quote appears when you press the new "quote / boost" button.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/status-quote-control.png" class="shadow" alt="The new boost/quote button" width="486" height="59">
 
Tapping this opens a menu to choose between boosting or quoting the post.

The menu appears even if the original poster does not let you quote the post, so you can see *why* quoting the post is not possible. This also ensures you don't tap the button intending to quote and inadvertently boost the post instead.

> Note: You cannot quote direct messages.

If you choose to quote the post the editor opens as normal.

The text of the post you are quoting is copied to area at the top of the screen (also used for replies). This makes it easy to refer back to the text you are quoting, and copy some of the text into your own post if you want.

If the post you are quoting has a content warning then it is also set as the default content warning for your post, although you can remove it.

Mastodon does not allow quote-posts to have polls or media attachments. If you are quoting a post the attachment menu (paperclip icon) is disabled.

A new "Quote" Accessbility action has been added. 

#### Viewing a quoted post

A post quoting another post currently shows the quoted post below the main body of the post, with a slightly smaller icon, and one step-down in font size.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/view-quote.png" class="shadow" alt="A post with a quoted post" width="486" height="509">

If the quoted post matches one of your "warn" filters it is hidden, with an option to click through the filter to view the post.

If the quoted post matches one of your "hide" filters it is hidden. You can not click through, but a note to show quoted content was present is shown. Otherwise the parent post may look strange without any context that it contained a quote.

Similarly, if the quoted post is written by an account you have blocked or muted, or from a domain you have blocked, the quoted post is replaced with a note explaining why it is hidden.

If the quoted post is a post you have written (the screenshot shows an example) you can use the "Remove quote" button to remove your quote from this post.

Tapping on the quoted post behaves similarly to tapping on a regular post; hashtags can be viewed, links can be clicked, attachments can be opened, etc. Tapping the quoted post's text opens the original post's thread.

The post's "&hellip;" menu has a new "Open quoted post" item which also does this.

<img src="/assets/posts/2025-11-xx-3.2.0-release/quote-detail.png" class="shadow" alt="Thread view, with new 'Quotes' count" width="486" height="643">

In the detailed view the number of times the post has been quoted is shown, and you can tap this to see all the posts quoting this one.

#### Notifications about quotes

There are two new quote-related notifications. They are enabled by default.

One notifies you whenever one of your posts is quoted. The notification shows the post quoting yours, with a "Remove quote" button if you want to remove your quoted post from theirs.

The other notifies you whenever a post you have quoted has been edited. You may want to review the new content of the post, and decide whether you want to continue quoting it or not.

Mastodon does not let you remove a post you have quoted from one of your posts, so if you do not want to continue quoting it you must delete your post.

## Significant bug fixes

### Make "Load newest notifications" work

[@dnkrupinski@hannover.town](https://hannover.town/@dnkrupinski) reported the "Load newest notifications" menu wasn't working. Fixed with #[1941](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1941)

### Load images from sites using LetsEncrypt certificates

I noticed the changes in [Android 7 devices and Let's Encrypt](/pachli/2024/04/29/2.5.0-release.html#android-7-devices-and-lets-encrypt) weren't being applied to the code loading images.

Fixed with #[1946](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1946). As a side-effect the image and post cache is now shared, so Pachli should use a little less memory and disk space.

### Show emojis in author names in preview bylines

If provided, preview cards show the name of the author that wrote the linked article. Emojis in the account name weren't being displayed properly. Fixed with #[1903](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1903).

### Use the correct ID when translating boosted posts

Translating a boosted post wasn't showing the translation result (it was being stored under the ID of the post-doing-the-boosting, not the post-being-boosted). Fixed with #[1929](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1929).

### Improve display of error causes on timelines

A confluence of issues meant detailed error messages when loading timelines were sometimes replaced with a generic "An error occurred" message. Fixed with #[1924](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1924).

### Show display names with some RTL characters correctly

Names starting with characters going left-to-right, but contained some right-to-left characters, for example, a name using Latin characters first, then Hebrew, were being shown right-to-left. Fixed with #[1913](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1913).
