When the project launched [About Pachli](/about) described the goals for Pachli-the-association, and noted that:

> At the time of writing it is undecided whether Pachli-the-association will exist as a separate entity, or whether those goals can be met under the wing of an organisation like the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/), or the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org/)."

Read on for update on that process.

**Software in the Public Interest**

I'm following their [Associated Project HOWTO](https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/associated-project-howto/), with nothing to report so far.

**Software Freedom Conservancy**

After initial discussions with Software Freedom Conservancy my expectation that the project would a better fit with another organisation was confirmed. Excellent interaction with the organisation though, and I'd recommend them to other, larger projects that better meet their mission of "*ensure the right to repair, improve and reinstall software.*"

**Nivenly**

After some initial e-mail conversation I've also met with Quintessence Anx, Executive Director of the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) to learn more and discuss whether Pachli might be a fit under their umbrella. As the proverb goes [there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_many_a_slip_%27twixt_the_cup_and_the_lip), but I expect to be filling in the more detailed application form soon.

To quote again from the About Pachli page:

> **When does the association and membership start?**
>
>The goal is somewhen before the end of November 2023.
>
>Ideally, one of the organisations mentioned earlier will agree to host the project. That takes time, and may be an unusual request for them; to my knowledge they normally only host existing open source projects, so this may be too far outside their comfort zone.
>
>That would be very understandable.
>
>If it is, starting a Swiss association along these lines is relatively straightforward.

That's still on-track.
