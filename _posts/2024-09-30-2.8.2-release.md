Pachli 2.8.2 is now available. This release saves your reading position in more situations, allows you to put downloaded media in sub-folders, and adds an experimental preference to control what happens when you tap a tab.

## New features and other improvements

### Save downloaded media to sub-folders

[Martin Melcher](https://social.cologne/@bee8bit) made their first feature request, suggesting it should be possible to choose to save downloaded media in folders named according to the sender's account (#[938](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/938)).

This is done. Open "Preferences" and there is a new setting controlling this. Default behaviour is as before, media is saved to the *Downloads* folder. You can choose instead to either have it saved to a sub-folder named after your account, or a sub-folder named after the account that posted the media.

### Jump to newest posts when tapping a tab

The default behaviour when tapping a tab is to jump up a "page" of posts. Typically about 40, but it depends on your server. If there are more posts to fetch they will be automatically loaded. So you can tap repeatedly on the tab to page up through your feed, eventually reaching the top.

[AndyGER](https://troet.cafe/@andreas_heitmann) [suggested](https://troet.cafe/@andreas_heitmann/113154370913793768) this behaviour should be changeable, and a single tap should load the absolute newest posts on your server (as the "Load newest posts" menu item does).

This is also done. At the moment it's a setting in the new "Preferences > Lab experiments" section to get feedback ahead of next month's release, where it might be promoted to a regular preference.

### Updates to translations

Languages with updated translations are:

- Irish by [Aindriú Mac Giolla Eoin](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=aindriu80@gmail.com)
- Galician by [josé m](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=correoxm@disroot.org)

If you would like to help improve Pachli's translation in to your language there's [information on how you can contribute](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/blob/main/docs/contributing/translate.md).

## Significant bug fixes

### Remember the reading position when a post doesn't fit on the screen

Pachli tries to remember and restore your reading position in your home timeline.

This wasn't always happening. If a post didn't fully fit on the screen then your reading position wasn't saved, and when you re-opened Pachli you would be returned to the last post that did fit.

This could happen in two cases:

1. You had scrolled to a single post that was so long it did not fit on the screen
2. You had scrolled to a point where two posts were visible on the screen, and the top of the first post and the bottom of the second post were not visible

This is fixed.
