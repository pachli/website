Pachli 2.13.0 is now available. This release makes it easier to add captions to media attachments, replaces the Local timeline with the Trending timeline when logging in for the first time, and more.

## New features and other improvements

### Make media descriptions more prominent when writing posts

Media descriptions are an important part of the online experience for many people.

Previously, to add a description in Pachli you had to add the attachment, then tap the attachment to bring up a menu, choose the "Edit caption" option from the menu, and type the caption in the dialog that popped up.

Now this is integrated in to the UI when writing a post. Adding media immediately shows you the description field, how many characters you can include in the description, and clearly indicates a description is good practice.

You can type directly in the description field, without having to make multiple taps to navigate through menus.

### Replace "Local" timeline with "Trending posts" in default tabs

When you first sign in to an account with Pachli the default set of tabs used to include the "Local" timeline for your server. On large servers this is often unhelpful; a firehose of posts which may or may have appropriate content warnings or match your interests.

The "Local" timeline has been replaced with the "Trending posts" timeline. For new users this is likely to be more immediately useful and give them a better onboarding experience.

This change only affects new accounts signed in to Pachli. If you were using Pachli before 2.13.0 your tabs have not been changed.

The "Local" timeline **has not** been removed, it is still available from the main navigation menu, and can be added to a tab with one tap on the "Add to tab" button.

This works for all timelines that are not currently in tabs.
