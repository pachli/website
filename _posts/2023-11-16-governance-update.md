In the last [governance update](/pachli/2023/09/27/governance-update.html) I mentioned starting the application process with the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org).

As announced in their [Updates for October and November](https://nivenly.org/blog/2023/11/14/updates-for-october-and-november/) blog post the Pachli application process is underway.

There are two Q&A discussions currently happening in their forums:

- [Pachli discussion for Nivenly members](https://nivenly.discourse.group/t/pachli-member-discussion-and-q-a-thread/68)
- [Pachli discussion for non-members](https://nivenly.discourse.group/t/pachlis-application-public-q-a-and-discussion-thread/64)

If you have questions please do come along and ask.
