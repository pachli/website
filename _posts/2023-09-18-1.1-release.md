## Fix crash on entering MainActivity on tablets

This was first [reported by Matthew Dye](https://mastodon.social/@mjd/111031884970306701), who also noted that the [themed icon was too large](https://mastodon.social/@mjd/111035060684158675), with both problems affecting Pixel C tablets.

Richard Merren noted the same crash on Samsung tablets, and Sebastiano Poggi reported the crash on Pixel Fold tablets.

Both issues are fixed.

## Ensure refreshing does not create a gap in the timeline

Pachli was forked from another Mastodon client, Tusky, and inherited a bug triggered when you refresh your timeline.

In certain circumstances the refresh would leave large gaps in the timeline. For example, if you leave the app overnight, and refresh in the morning, it's likely that many posts that arrived overnight will not be shown, despite appearing in the Mastodon web UI.

This is fixed.

## Restore the user's home timeline position

When you re-open the app after a period away it should restore your reading position to the same post you were looking at when you left, assuming that post is still visible to your account (it's not been deleted, you haven't muted or blocked the poster, etc).

Pachli is now better at doing this.

Some issues still remain, and are tracked in [issue #53](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/53).

## Show the FAB according to the user's preferences

The "FAB" is the "Floating Action Button" at the bottom right of the screen that allows you to create a new post or otherwise perform some action.

There is a preference to hide this button when you are scrolling lists, and it wasn't honoured in many cases.

DoKo [reported this](https://freiburg.social/@DoKo/111034289908426344), and it is now fixed.

## Fix toolbar flickering when scrolling lists

I noticed that scrolling some lists would result in the toolbar at the top of the screen flickering. This should now be fixed in all cases.

There have been related cosmetic changes; I noticed some colours were incorrect, and Jener [reported a significant accessibility issue with preference colours](https://nuvem.lgbt/@Jener/111081833582644490) which is also fixed.

## Thank you

Thank you to everyone who took the time to report issues and provide additional followup information and screenshots.
