Pachli 2.1.0 is now available. This is primarily a bug fix release ahead of planned work next year to extend and improve the translation support that landed in 2.0.0.

This should be the last Pachli release of 2023, with development work resuming early in 2024.

Read on for more details about this, and other changes in this release.

## New features and other improvements

### Show role badges on profiles

Mastodon accounts can have roles associated with them. For example, a server's "Owner", or "Moderator". Other roles can also be created and assigned by the server operators.

If any roles are assigned to your account they are now visible if you view your profile (#[312](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/312)). This was based on work originally carried out by [connyduck](https://chaos.social/@ConnyDuck) in #[4029](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky/pull/4029)

If you have a role badge on your profile it will look like this mockup.

### Compose posts in more places

[sanao](https://mastodon.social/@sanao1006) continued their usability improvement work allowing you to compose new posts from more places.

You can now compose a new post when viewing a list (#[279](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/279)) and bookmarks (#[278](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/278)).

### Updates to translations

[Jener Gomes](https://github.com/JenerGomes), [Kalle Kniivilä](https://github.com/kallekn), [sanao](https://github.com/sanao1006), and [Luna Jernberg](https://github.com/bittin) all submitted changes to the different Pachli translations, improving things for users who speak Spanish and Brazilian Portugese, Finnish, Japanese, and Swedish respectively.

If you would like to help improve Pachli's translation in to your language there's [information on how you can contribute](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/blob/main/docs/contributing/translate.md).

## Significant bug fixes

### Missing translations when viewing a thread

[Ângelo](https://tinsuke.com/) noticed that if you translated a post in a thread, left the thread, and then viewed the thread again the translated content could disappear. That was fixed in #[320](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/320).

### Calculate post and poll length correctly

If you included an emoji in a post or a poll option it could sometimes count as two characters when checking the post or option's length, not one. This is inconsistent with how Mastodon counts the characters, and could result in Pachli rejecting a valid post as being too long. That was fixed in #[315](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/315), partially based on work originally carried out by [connyduck](https://chaos.social/@ConnyDuck) in #[4152](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky/pull/4152)

### Unintended crashes and memory leaks

A few places where Pachli could crash have been fixed:

- A preview card does not have an author (#[310](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/310))
- An error is shown in a timeline without a compose button (#[310](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/310))
- Showing a profile that does not have a `createdAt` date (#[310](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/310))
- Using a quick tile on some devices (#[288](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/288))

There was also a small memory leak when some transparent avatars were displayed, fixed in #[309](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/309), based on work originally carried out by [connyduck](https://chaos.social/@ConnyDuck) in #[4150](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky/pull/4150).


## Updated app store images

[Korb](https://github.com/Korb) opened #[304](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/304) to note that the existing app store screenshots didn't make it clear that there were different colour themes available. As part of fixing that I took the opportunity to generate some new screenshots as the Pachli UI has also changed in a few places since the 1.0 release.
