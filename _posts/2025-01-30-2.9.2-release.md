Pachli 2.9.2 is now available. This release shows lists ordered by name in all places, allows you to create filters on Akkoma servers, and contains some small improvements to error handling.

<!--more-->

Some significant refactoring work to support the [anti-harassment controls](pachli/2024/08/02/harassment-controls.html) is happening at the moment, but isn't in a state where it can be released outside [Pachli Current](/download/#pachli-current).

## New features and other improvements

### Show lists sorted by title

[Tobias Zeumer](https://github.com/tzeumer) noted (#[1168](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1168)) Pachli wasn't always displaying lists in alphabetical order, and was using the order they were sent by your server (which is typically the date each list was created).

This is now always alphabetical by the list's title to make it easier to find a specific list.

### Enable filtering on Akkoma servers

A user e-mailed to report an error trying to use filters on their [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/) server. Pachli's list of server software capabilities was incorrect, causing the error.

This is fixed, and (client-side) filters should work if your account is on an Akkoma server.

### Remove "dummy.placeholder" text from network error messages

For [technical reasons](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1217) network errors show the server name as `dummy.placeholder`, which can be confusing.

This is fixed.

### Updates to translations

## Significant bug fixes

### Don't crash if a database error occurs during login

When you start Pachli you are re-logged in to your account and your on-device database is updated with information about your account. If a database error occurred during this time (which would be a bug) then Pachli crashed instead of showing an error message.
