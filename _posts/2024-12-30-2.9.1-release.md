Pachli 2.9.1 is now available. This release allows you to view a timeline of posts discussing a trending link, makes the Nynorsk variant of the Norwegian language selectable as a UI language, adds additional information to error messages, and contains the usual set of bug fixes and other small improvements.

## New features and other improvements

### Show posts discussing a trending link

Pachli allows you to view links to articles your server marks as trending. To see them, choose "Trending" from the main navigation menu, and then the "Links" tab.

Newer versions of Mastodon support viewing a timeline of posts mentioning one of these links. If your server supports this you will now see a message below each link's card, for example "See **248** posts about this link".

Tap that to view the posts and join the discussion.

### Choose Norwegian Nynorsk as a UI language

[Sunniva Løvstad](https://sunniva.garden/en) has been contributing a Norwegian Nynorsk translation of the Pachli UI.

She noted (#[1159](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1159)) this was only available if your device was set to the language, and there was no Pachli UI for this.

Now there is, and you can choose it directly from Pachli's preferences (#[1162](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1162)) like any other language Pachli supports.

### Improved error reporting

To make user problem reports easier to troubleshoot errors caused by network issues now show include details of the exact API call being made.

### Updates to translations

Languages with updated translations are:

- Finnish by [Kalle Kniivilä](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=kalle.kniivila@gmail.com)
- Irish by [Aindriú Mac Giolla Eoin](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=aindriu80@gmail.com)
- Norwegian Nynorsk by [Sunniva Løvstad](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=schildkroteskoldpadda@gmail.com)
- Spanish by [Juan M Sevilla](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=jumase@disroot.org)
- Swedish by [jens persson](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=jens@persson.cx)

## Significant bug fixes

### Sporadic "KeyStoreException: BKS not found" log in errors

A [number of users](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/1143) reported seeing "KeyStoreException: BKS not found" error messages when logging in.

This should now be fixed.

Tangentially related to this, some errors when logging in did not include sufficient troubleshooting information. That is also fixed.

### Show unknown notification types correctly

Your Mastodon server might send notifications with a type that Pachli does not recognise.

For example, the most recent "Mastodon wrapped" notifications your server may have opted in to. These were announced at the last minute with no coordination with app developers.

This highlighted a Pachli bug where unknown notification types were shown incorrectly. This has been fixed in #[1154](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1154).

### Don't crash when toggling an account's "Show boosts" option

After following an account you can choose if you want to see *all* posts from the account (including posts they have boosted) or just their original content.

A previous change caused this to crash. This is fixed in #[1149](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1149).

### Show edits to a post's content warning

You can tap on the timestamp at the bottom of an edited post to see a history of the changes to the post, with the differences over time highlighted.

Pachli inherited a Tusky bug (in code I wrote) where changes to a post's content warning were not highlighted. This could lead to user confusion if the content warning was the only part of the post that had been edited.

Fixed with #[1144](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1144).
