Pachli 1.4.0 is now available.

Assuming things go to plan this will be the final release in the 1.x series. The 2.x series will be released soon, featuring support for translating posts.

The significant changes in this release are:

## New features and other improvements

### Warn you if Pachli is out of date

Your Pachli installation might be out of date.

- If you have installed Pachli from F-Droid it's possible (via repository switching) to get in to a state where F-Droid does not prompt you to update
- If you installed the APK from the GitHub release page you might have forgotten to update
- The Google Play Store shows that a reasonable fraction of Pachli users are not being prompted to update

This is a problem for several reasons:

- If a security issue is discovered in Pachli or one of its dependencies it's important to be able to rapidly deploy fixes
- Users can waste time suffering through -- and reporting -- issues that have been fixed in newer versions of Pachli

To protect against this Pachli will now warn you (approximately once per day) if the app is out of date, based on wherever you downloaded it from (F-Droid, GitHub, or Google Play), with a link to install the newest update from there.

When prompted you have the option of disabling this functionality entirely. You can also disable the prompt for the specific new version, and still be prompted when the version *after that* is released. If you do disable this functionality it can be re-enabled in the preferences.

Pachli **does not** auto-update.

### Updates to the Italian translation

[chaoscalm](https://github.com/chaoscalm) corrected some of the existing Italian translation and contributed additional translated text (PR#[240](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/240)).

## Significant bug fixes

### Restore image aspect ratio when dragging

[Daniele Conti](https://androiddev.social/@fourlastor) reported ([#202](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/202)) that if you dragged an image and released it the aspect ratio could be incorrect. This was fixed in PR#[207](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/207)

### Fix preference regressions in 1.3.0

The 1.3.0 release refactored how preferences were handled, and unexpectedly broke how preference changes are communicated within the app. This would manifest as, for example, changing the UI colour scheme from light to dark and that change only taking effect when you restarted Pachli, instead of immediately as intended.

This was reported by [Clément L](https://github.com/Porkepix) in [#225](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/225) and fixed in PR#[234](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/234).

### Show navigation/status bar with correct colours

[Clément L](https://github.com/Porkepix) also noted that that the status bar (at the top of the screen) and navigation bar (at the bottom of the screen) could use incorrect colours/transparency on older Android devices, making them difficult or impossible to see ([#221](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/221)), fixed in PR#[224](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/224).
