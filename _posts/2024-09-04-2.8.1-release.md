Pachli 2.8.1 is now available. This fixes a crash when uploading media and corrects two UI problems.

<!--more-->

## Significant bug fixes

### Fix crash when posting media

In some cases Pachli could crash if you tried to send a post while the media for the post was still uploading. This is fixed, you can upload again with impunity.

### Restore transitions when opening a video

Pachli shows videos in your timeline as a still image, and when you tap the image it should smoothly transition to the full screen video player.

[Jasdemi](https://jasdemi.com/@jasdemi) reported this was not working correctly in #[920](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/920).

Investigation showed a [bug in newer versions of the Google media library](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/1594) on Android 14 broke this transition; the video still plays, but when you tap the video nothing appears to happen for a second or two before it starts playing. The bug has been worked around, and the transition is back.

### Prevent overlapping text on preview cards

In some rare situations the text on a preview card -- which shows you an image for the first link in any post and a few lines of summary text -- could overlap the image. Thanks to [Kalle Kniivil√§](https://mastodon.social/@kallekn@mastodonsweden.se) for reporting this.
