Pachli 2.7.1 is now available.

A change in [Pachli 2.7.0](/pachli/2024/07/29/2.7.0-release.html) could mis-format the preview cards in posts with links, if the image in the preview was in portrait orientation (taller than it is wide).

This is fixed in Pachli 2.7.1.

Thank you to [Kalle Kniivil√§](https://mastodonsweden.se/@kallekn) for reporting this.
