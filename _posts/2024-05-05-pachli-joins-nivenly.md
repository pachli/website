Since the Pachli project started the goal has been to provide a "[provide a first class organisation to manage the development of the application under the 7 cooperative principles](/about)".

The project is now a step closer to that goal, as the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) membership and board have [voted to accept the project's membership application](https://nivenly.org/blog/2024/04/26/pachli-decision/).

This news drops just as I'm about to leave for vacation, so there'll be more updates in late May / early June with concrete changes.

Sincere thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.
