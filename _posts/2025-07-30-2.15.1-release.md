Pachli 2.15.1 is now available. This release fixes a critical crash on older devices only discovered after 2.15.0 was released, and allows zoomed in images to scroll past the camera cutout.

## Significant bug fixes

### Don't crash on older devices loading role chip resources

Shortly after 2.15.0 was released (and while I was writing the announcment blog post), [Lennart Petersson](https://mastodonsweden.se/@lennart) [reported](https://mastodonsweden.se/@lennart/114942239800663951) that it was crashing on a Pixel XL.

The changes to display the role account badges were triggering an [Android bug](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/262851206) that hadn't occurred during testing.

This was fixed with #[1697](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/1697).

### Show large/zoomed images with padding to avoid the camera cutout

While I was creating the screenshots for the [2.15.0 release announcement](/pachli/2025/07/30/2.15.0-release.html) I noticed that if you had a device with a camera cutout on the display, opened an image attachment, and zoomed in, the image would take up the full size of the display, as expected.

However, the edges of the image couldn't go past the edge of the display, so the camera cutout would always obscure part of the image.

To fix this some additional padding is applied to all edges that need it. The image will still use the entire display, but now you can scroll past the edges of the image to position the camera cutout outside the image's dimensions.

## Thank you

Thank you to Lennart for taking the time to report the issue and provide additional followup information.
