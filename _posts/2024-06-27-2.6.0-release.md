Pachli 2.6.0 is now available. This release allows you to find new people to follow with a "Suggested accounts" feature, and has the usual bug fixes and other improvements.

Read on for more details about these.

## New features and other improvements

### Show "Suggested accounts"

Your Mastodon server can show you accounts you might want to follow, under "Explore -> People" in the web interface.

Pachli now shows those same suggestions, select "Suggested accounts" from the left-side navigation menu.

You can choose to either follow the account or dismiss the suggestion. Dismissing the suggestion does not block, mute, or otherwise change how you interact with the account in the future.

To make it easier to decide if you want to follow the account the bio is shown, as are details about the number of accounts it follows and follow it, and some statistics about their posting schedule.

### Better support for filters on servers running GoToSocial 0.16

GoToSocial 0.16 improved support for Mastodon filters (#[2936](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/pull/2936)). Pachli will use this if your server runs GoToSocial 0.16 or higher.

### Updates to translations

Languages with updated translations are:

- Finnish by [Kalle Kniivilä](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=kalle.kniivila@gmail.com)
- Spanish by [Miles Krell](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=noreply@mileskrell.com)
- Swedish by [Luna Jernberg](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/commits?author=bittin@reimu.nl)

If you would like to help improve Pachli's translation in to your language there's [information on how you can contribute](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/blob/main/docs/contributing/translate.md).

## Significant bug fixes

### Set font size and family when returning from Preferences

The "predictive back" changes a few releases ago had a bug. If you changed the font size or font family and pressed "Back" the new font options didn't apply until you restarted Pachli. That's been fixed.

### Editing a post's language no longer shows an error

[Kalle Kniivilä](https://mastodonsweden.se/@kallekn) reported editing a post and only changing the language would display an error message when you tried to post. You also weren't prompted to save the change if you pressed "Back" after making it. Fixed with #[780](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/780).

### Improve the readability of media labels

[JuanM](https://github.com/jumase) filed #[751](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/751) with screenshots showing if you disabled the "Download media previews" option and viewed posts with more than one image then the descriptions for each image were very close together, making them difficult to read.

#[778](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/778) fixes this. As well as including more whitespace between descriptions the media icons are now aligned to the top of the each description, making it easier to scan the content.

### Improve the readability of the navigation menu header

The account switcher at the top of the left-navigation menu shows the header image for the active account. [R. L. Dane](https://fosstodon.org/@RL_Dane) noted the image content could text in this area to be unreadable.

#[773](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/773) fixes this, drawing a partially transparent scrim across the area to ensure the text and control are always legible.

### Prevent crash if too many accounts are signed in

[Florian Berger](https://florian-berger.de/) reported a crash that occurred every time they added a sixth account (#[752](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/752)).

Pachli adds a shortcut every time you add an account (long-press the Pachli icon to see them), and some devices have a limit on the number of these shortcuts that can be added, crashing if the application exceeds it. Pachli now queries the device to determine how many shortcuts are allowed, and will not exceed the limit (#[771](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/771)).
