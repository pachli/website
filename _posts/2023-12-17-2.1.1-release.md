Pachli 2.1.1 is now available. This fixes one bug; if you were upgrading to Pachli 2.1, *and* you included trending tags, links, or posts in your tabs, Pachli 2.1 would crash when starting, and you had to remove and re-install the app.

Thanks to [Rainer Müller](https://hachyderm.io/@raimue) for the detailed bug report. This was fixed in #[330](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/330)
