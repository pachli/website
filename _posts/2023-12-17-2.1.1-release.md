Pachli 2.1.1 is now available. This fixes one bug; if you were upgrading to Pachli 2.1, *and* you included trending tags, links, or posts in your tabs, Pachli 2.1 would crash when starting, and you had to remove and re-install the app.

Thanks to [Rainer MÃ¼ller](https://hachyderm.io/@raimue) for the detailed bug report. This was fixed in #[330](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/pull/330)

[Download Pachli 2.1.1 from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.pachli), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.pachli/), or the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/releases/tag/v2.1.1).
