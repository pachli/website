# Choose a variant

Pachli is available in two variants:

- **Pachli** is the regular variant, released every month.
- **Pachli Current** is the pre-release variant, with new features and bug fixes that benefit from wider testing. Installing Pachli Current and [reporting any bugs](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/new/choose) you find is a very useful way to contribute to the project.

Pachli and Pachli Current can be installed at the same time and the two variants do not share any data.
