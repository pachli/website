You can also [download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/releases/latest).

There is typically a 12-24 hour delay before a new release is available on Google Play.

There is typically a 3-5 day delay before a new release is available on F-Droid.

# Pachli Current

**Pachli Current** is the pre-release version of Pachli, with new features and bug fixes that benefit from wider testing before a formal release.

Pachli Current can be installed at the same time as Pachli, and the two versions do not share any data.

Installing Pachli Current and [reporting any bugs](https://github.com/pachli/pachli-android/issues/new/choose) you find is a very useful way to contribute to the project.

Install Pachli Current from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.pachli.current).

Pachli Current is not available from F-Droid as the F-Droid repository does not support these sorts of releases ([#1153](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/issues/1153)).

# Source code
